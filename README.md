# Blind quartet

Blind Quartets works similarly to regular Quartets, in that each player's goal is to collect as many 'quartets', sets of 4 cards from the same category, as possible. The difference is that the categories and cards therein are initially unknown (hence 'Blind') and are only established during the game itself, instead of being fixed beforehand. In fact, the 'cards' are completely imaginary, and no physical items of any sort are required to play this game.
